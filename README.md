Screenshot/Image Arranger for A4 Printing

This Python script automatically arranges screenshots of 240 x 160 pixels onto A4-sized pages, making them ready for printing at the correct physical dimensions. 

The screenshots can also be resized, for example to match the original Game Boy Advance display size (61.2 mm x 40.8 mm) and organized with margins for an optimal layout.

Simply place your screenshots in a designated folder, run the script, and it will generate A4 pages with the arranged screenshots, saved as PNG files. This tool is ideal for those looking to print their screenshots in a clean and organized manner.
